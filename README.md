# 👋 Hey, I'm Khaled!

I'm a backend developer by trade and a full-stack developer by hobby. 

Most of my internships have been backend-focused, and most recently I've been working with **Apache Flink**, **Java**, and **PostgreSQL** — lots of data flow stuff.  But I also just enjoy building complete solutions from start to finish.  As you can see from my repos, I've got a real love for frontend design too.

I've got a few more projects I could share if you're interested.  If you're a recruiter or just curious about my work, feel free to contact me, I can always publish a few more of my projects if you need more insight.
